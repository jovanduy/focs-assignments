## I. Logic

### 1.

The following tables are [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

_true_ and _false_ are represented by `T` and `F`. _OR(false, true)_ is commonly written in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation): `F OR T`.

The second table shows the value of the function _a OR b_, for all possible values _a_ and _b_. For example, _false OR true_ (the second row) has the value _true_ (the final cell of that row).

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ AND _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | F
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ OR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

a. Construct the truth table for _a XOR (b XOR a)_.

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

b. Which function corresponds to the English word "or", as used in "You will eat your meat OR you can't have any pudding" (where _a_ = "You will eat your meat" and _b_ = "you can't have any pudding").

XOR corresponds to the English word "or" because normally when the word "or" is used, such as in that example, it means one or the other, but not both. The logical OR will be true if at least one of {a,b} is true, meaning both can be true. XOR is true if and only if exactly one of {a,b} is true.

## II. Questions 2–6 are the same as in-class activities 2-6

### 2.

Consider the following context-free grammar G:

```
E -> E + E | T         # <- added "| T"
T -> T x T | (E) | a
```

Convert G to a PDA.

### 3.

Convert grammar G from (2) to Chomsky Normal Form.

```
S_o → E
E   → a | EE_1
T   → TT_1 | LT_2
E_1 → PE
T_1 → XT
T_2 → ER
P   → +
X   → x
L   → (
R   → )
```


### 4.

Is the grammar G's language a regular language? If yes, produce a FSA or regular expression for this language. If not, show this.

### 5.

Theorem 1: The language {a^n b^n c^n} is not a context-free language.

a. Use Theorem 1, together with the languages {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j}, to show that the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.

b. Use the pumping lemma for context-free languages [Sipser pp. 125] to prove Theorem 1.

### 6.

Consider the context-free grammar G:

```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```

a. Show that the string "the girl touches the boy with the flower" has two
different leftmost derivations.

**Derivation 1**
![derivation 1](images/derivation1.png)
S → NP VP → DET N VP → the N VP → the girl VP → the girl VP PP → the girl V NP PP → the girl touches NP PP → the girl touches DET N PP → the girl touches the N PP → the girl touches the boy PP → the girl touches the boy P NP → the girl touches the boy with NP → the girl touches the boy with DET N → the girl touches the boy with the N → the girl touches the boy with the flower

**Derivation 2**
![derivation 2](images/derivation2.png)
S → NP VP → DET N VP → the N VP → the girl VP → the girl V NP → the girl touches NP → the girl touches NP PP → the girl touches DET N PP → the girl touches the N PP → the girl touches the boy PP → the girl touches the boy P NP → the girl touches the boy with NP → the girl touches the boy with DET N → the girl touches with boy with the → the girl touches the boy with the flower

b. Describe in English the two different meanings of this sentence.

The first derivation means that the girl uses flowers to touch the boy. The second derivation means that the girl touches a boy, and that boy has flowers.

c. Use G to generate another ambiguous sentence.

d. Modify G so that it generates strings with adjectives: `the girl saw the tall boy`, `the girl touches the boy with a purple flower`.

```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N | DET ADJP
ADJP -> ADJ N
ADJ -> tall | purple
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```



You don't need to know this, but here's how the variable names relate to linguistics.

Variable | meaning
---|---
S | sentence
DET | determiner (article)
N | noun
NP | noun phrase
P | preposition
PP | prepositional phrase
V | verb
VP | verb phrase
